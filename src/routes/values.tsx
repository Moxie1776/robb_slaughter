          <ul>
            <li>
              I believe all people are created equally and as that they should
              all be treated with respect.
            </li>
            <li>
              I believe and support the Constitution of the United States.
            </li>
            <li>
              I believe everyone has the right to their own spiritual faith. As
              such, their rights to religious practices should be protected.
            </li>
            <li>
              I believe the United States of America is the best country in the
              world and that its form of Government is the model that all
              nations should subscribe to.
            </li>
            <li>I believe in the value of the family.</li>
            <li>
              I believe all immigrants should be granted a path to citizenship.
              Anyone who desires to meet the required steps should be accepted.
              However it is critical that we protect our borders from
              infringement by any non-citizen.
            </li>
            <li> I believe in the need for public and national safety.</li>
            <li> I support our law enforcement and our Military.</li>
            <li>
              {' '}
              I believe that once a child is conceived it is a viable human
              being.{' '}
            </li>
            <li>
              I believe in the 2nd Amendment and whole heartedly support our
              citizenâ€™s rights to keep and bear arms.
            </li>
            <li>
              I believe in smaller government involvement and no more taxes than
              necessary. Taxes collected must be used for the benefit of the
              people.
